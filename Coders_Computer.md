# What I Learned Installing Software

- I learned that you can install Ubuntu App inside of Windows without using a different test computer.
* I installed the following apps on my computer:
  * Ubuntu App for Windows
  * VSCode
  * Node.js
  * Eslint
  * Git
  
 Install was pretty easy. Had to Google a few errors but was able to fix issues that I had. Having some Linux Command line experience helped.
