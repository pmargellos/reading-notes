## My Thoughts on Growth Mindset

My thoughts on _growth mindset_ are that in order to achieve your highest potential, you need to be  willing to embrace the challenge of learning something new. You also need to keep in mind that you may fail in some of the tasks along the way, but every failure you have is something new that you’ve learned that doesn’t work. If you are persistent and keep trucking ahead, you will learn something new.
