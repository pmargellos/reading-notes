# Module 3 Notes
## Title: Revisions in the Cloud
### Reading Notes

The reading for Module 3 was Git Intro.
I learned that there are there are 3 versions of Version Control.
- Local Version Control - One database on your local pc hard disk that stores changes to files.
- Centralized Version Control - Single Server storing all changes and file versions. that can be accessed my various clients.
- Distributed Version Control - Multiple mirrored respositories. The data backups can easily be placed on servers to replace lost information.

In my opinion the best version control would be Distributed Version Control. There would be a backup of your code. So that if a server goes down you don't loose what you have worked on.
