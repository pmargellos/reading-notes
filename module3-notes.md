# Module 3 Notes
## Title: Revisions in the Cloud
### Reading Notes

The reading for Module 3 was Git Intro.
I learned that there are 3 versions of Version Control.
- Local Version Control - One database on your local pc hard disk that stores changes to files.
- Centralized Version Control - Single Server storing all changes and file versions that can be accessed by various clients.
- Distributed Version Control - Multiple mirrored respositories. The data backups can easily be placed on servers to replace lost information.

In my opinion the best version control would is the Distributed Version Control. There would be a backup of your code, so that if a server goes down you don't lose what the code that you have worked on.
